  Layout is hard. It's something I struggled with when I started
  out and it's something that always raises lots of questions in the
  classroom.

  To help ease the pain, I've compiled a guide to *layout &amp; document flow*
  along with a 90-minute screencast mini-series to help both beginners and
  experienced web professionals sharpen this fundamental skill.

benefits: |
  * Learn to master CSS layout by writing *fewer lines* of code.
  * Learn how document flow works and how to control it.
  * Learn techniques you can use *now* on production sites.
  * Learn about the exciting future of CSS layout.

  Layout is hard. It's something I struggled with when I started
  out and it's something that always raises lots of questions in the
  classroom.

  Learning __this fundamental skill is key to building engaging, responsive,
  modern layouts for the web__ to allow your customers and clients to
  succeed online.

  This ebook starts with __building blocks of layout__ - inline, block and
  inline-block elements - and explains how they all work together and flow
  within the document. You'll learn about the CSS cascade, specificity, inheritance,
  and more complex advanced topics like margin collapse, float, positioning
  and document flow.

  The second section of the book is __100% practical__ and takes you step by step
  through the process of writing the CSS to build a simple site from scratch.
  __A 90-minute video screencast series__ has also been produced to accompany this
  practical section.

  Finally, you'll learn about __layout tools of the future__: Flexbox and the new
  Grid Layout module.

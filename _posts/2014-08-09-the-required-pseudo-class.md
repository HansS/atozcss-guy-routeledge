`:required` is another state based pseudo class that can be useful when
styling forms.

Combined with `:valid` and `:invalid` we can have a lot of control over
providing visual feedback to users without having to write lots of
JavaScript.

In this episode we'll learn:

* How to enable HTML5 form validation
* Using `:required` and other form state-based pseudo classes
* A creative technique for displaying validation messages to users

## HTML5 Validation

When asking a user to fill out a form, it's very common to have certain
fields marked as mandatory. These might be name, email address or credit
card details.

In HTML5 we can leverage client-side validation without JavaScript as
the behaviour is built into modern browsers.

To create a required field in a form, the `required` attribute is added
to the HTML.

{% highlight html %}
<form action="#" method="#">
	<div>
		<input id="name" type="text" required>
		<label for="name">Your name</label>
	</div>
	<div>
		<input id="email" type="email" required>
		<label for="email">Your email</label>
	</div>
	<div>
		<input id="phone" type="tel">
		<label for="phone">Your phone number</label>
	</div>
	<div>
		<textarea id="message" required></textarea>
		<label for="message">
	</div>
	<div><input type="submit"></div>
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

As `required` is a boolean attribute, it's presence on an element is
enough to set the value so the attribute value doesn't need to be
specified. 

It's also worth noting that in HTML5 elements like `input`
that don't have a closing tag, no longer need to be self-closed with
a slash; I think it looks tidier without so have left them off.

With these required attributes added to the markup, when I attempt to
submit the form without completing those fields, I get a series of
tooltip messages asking for the field to be "filled out" - these are
auto generated by the browser and can't be given custom styling as far
as I know.

## Using `:required`

With the `required` attribute added to the markup, we can use it to add
a bit of visual feedback to let users know which fields must be filled
in.

The HTML structure is important here, each input and label combination
is contained within a div and the label comes *after* the input. This
will become clear later on. We can still have the label appear before
the input by floating them to opposite sides of the form container and
clearing each container accordingly.

I want to add an asterisk after each label for a required input. Using
knowledge of the general sibling selector and pseudo elements from
previous episodes, I can generate the asterisk for any labels that
follow a required input.

If your design requires a different markup structure, with the label
before the input, a similar effect could be achieved but you'd need to
add a class to the parent container to get the right styling.

The opposite of "required" is "optional" and we can make this clear in
our form by adding the text "optional" to any inputs that aren't
expicitly `required`. The `:optional` pseudo class has us covered here.

{% highlight css %}
input:optional ~ label:after { 
	content:" (optional)";
	color:#ccc; 
}
{% endhighlight %}

As our users fill in the form, we can provide extra visual feedback as
to whether they have correctly filled in their details by styling the
`:valid` and `:invalid` states.

{% highlight css %}
input[type="text"]:valid:focus,
input[type="tel"]:valid:focus,
input[type="email"]:valid:focus,
textarea:valid:focus {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2);
  outline:0;
}
input[type="text"]:invalid:focus,
input[type="tel"]:invalid:focus,
input[type="email"]:invalid:focus,
textarea:invalid:focus {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2);
  outline:none;
}
{% endhighlight %}

These two snippets will add a subtle red shadow behind invalid inputs as
they're being filled in, and a subtle green shadow behind any valid
inputs.

## Validation messages

We can use the same techniques we've already covered, using state based
pseudo classes and generating content with pseudo elements to add more
descriptive validation messages to our form.

I've created a series of messages that will be injected via the
`content` property of various combinations of valid and invalid fields.

These can then be animated into position when the user focuses the input
and will change based on the valid or invalid state. 

{% highlight css %}
input:focus:invalid ~ label:before {
	content:"Fill this in";
	bottom:100%;
	color:red;
	opacity:1;
}
input:focus:valid ~ label:before {
	content:"All good!";
	bottom:100%;
	color:green;
	opacity:1;
}
label:before {
	content:"";
	position:absolute;
	bottom:0;
	right:0;
	opacity:0;
	transition:all 0.2s 0.1s ease;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now when we fill out the form, we get a bit more info about each step of
the process.

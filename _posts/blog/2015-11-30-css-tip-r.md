  In this quick CSS tips post, learn all about the `rem` unit, how and
  when to use it and why it has some benefits over the `em` unit.

In the original screencast video we learned all about [the `:required`
pseudo class](http://www.atozcss.com/r) which is useful for styling
forms with fields that must be filled in.

As much as forms, validation and styling state are big topics there
isn't too much we didn't cover on the topic of `:required` the first
time around. So instead, let's look at a couple of quick tips for using
the `rem` unit of measurement. But first, let's look at another type of
relative unit: the `em`.

## The pros and cons of using `em`s

When working in a responsive project it's more flexible to use relative
units like `em` for sizing text and spacing in and around elements
rather than pixels. This is because this unit is relative to the font
size of its parent element, allowing an element's size, spacing and text
content to grow proportionally as the `font-size` of parent elements
change. 

Using these relative units enables you to build a *system of
proportions* where changing values of `font-size` on one element has
a cascading effect on the child elements within.

Take the following snippet of HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<ul>
	<li>lorem ipsum</li>
	<li>dolor sit
		<ol>
			<li>lorem ipsum</li>
			<li>lorem ipsum</li>
			<li>lorem ipsum</li>
			<li>lorem ipsum</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

This nested list isn't the most common thing in the world but could
likely appear in a page of terms and conditions or some other kind of
formal document.

If we wanted to make the list items stand out, we could set their
`font-size` to be 1.5 times the size of the base size of `16px`.

{% highlight css %}
li { 
	font-size: 1.5em; /* 24px / 16px */
}
{% endhighlight %}

But this will cause an issue with the nested `li` as they will be 1.5
times the size of their parent too. The nested items will by 1.5 times
`24px` rather than 1.5 times `16px`. The result is that any nested list
items will grow exponentially with each level of nesting. This is likely
not what the designer intended!

A similiar problem occurs with nested elements and `em` values of less
than 1. In this case any nested items would keep getting incrementatlly
smaller with each level of nesting. 

So what can we do instead?


## Use `rem` for setting text size

Instead of running the risk of ever-increasing or decreasing `font-size`
we can use an alternative unit. 

We could use pixels but relative units are more flexible in responsive
projects. Instead, we can use the `rem` unit as this is always
calculated based on the `font-size` of the `:root` element which is
normally the `html` element in the case of a website or web application.
In an `svg` or `xml` document the root element might be different but
those types of documents aren't our concern here.

If we use `rem` for setting `font-size` it doesn't mean the humble
`em` should never get a look in. I tend to use `em` for setting
`padding` within elements so that the spacing is always relative to the
size of the text.

## Use Sass to help with `rem` browser support

The `rem` unit is only supported from IE9 and above. If you need to
support IE8 (or below) then you can use a JS polyfil or provide a `px`
fallback in the following way:

{% highlight css %}
li {
	font-size:24px;
	font-size:1.5rem;
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you're using Sass you could create a mixin and a function for
calculating the desired size in `rem` and providing the fallback
automatically.

{% highlight sass %}
@function rem-calc( $font-size, $base-font-size:16px ) {
	@return ( $size / $base-font-size ) * 1rem;
}
@mixin rem-with-px-fallback( $size, $property:font-size ) {
	#{$property}: $size;
	#{$property}: rem-calc( $size );
}
li {
	@include rem-with-px-fallback( 24px );
}
{% endhighlight %}

There you have it. A couple of quick tips for using `rem`. If you're not
using them in your current projects, I'd definitely recommend giving
them a try.

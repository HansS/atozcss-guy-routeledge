excerpt: >
  Vertical centering is a firm favourite of designers - for both print
  and digital media. But aligning things vertically with CSS is not the
  easiest thing to do. This issue is made worse in a world of multiple
  devices and responsive design as we need our elements to be flexible
  in height - which can make calculating their vertical center quick
  tricky.

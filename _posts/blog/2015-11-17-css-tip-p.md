  Pseudo elements are elements on the page that aren't found in the HTML
  code.  They can be manipulated with any CSS that would be applied to
  any other element. Here I'll share a couple of quick tips for styling
  input placeholder text. There's more to it than you might think!
---

Pseudo elements `:before` and `:after` are great for building complex
design features without cluttering the markup with non-semantic
elements. Other pseudo elements like `:first-line` and `:first-letter`
give us access to styling parts of elements that aren't found marked up
in the HTML document. 

We looked at many of these in the [Pseudo Elements
screencast](http://www.atozcss.com/p) but one pseudo element we didn't
look at was for styling placeholder text. Let's fix that.


## Selecting input placeholders

First, let's imagine the following HTML

{% highlight html %}
<input class="name-field" type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
{% endhighlight %}

We could set the color of the input text to red as follows 

{% highlight css %}
.name-field {
	color:red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We could also select and style the input from it's placeholder attribute

{% highlight css %}
input[placeholder="Enter your name"] {
	color:red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

But this will still style the text of any *user input* typed into the
field, rather than styling the appearance of the placeholder text
itself. To do that we need a series of vendor prefixed selectors for the
placeholder pseudo element.

{% highlight css %}
::-webkit-input-placeholder {
   color: red;
}

:-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 18- */
   color: red;  
}

::-moz-placeholder {  /* Firefox 19+ */
   color: red;  
}

:-ms-input-placeholder {  
   color: red;  
}
{% endhighlight %}

This may appear like a lot of duplication but unfortunately there is no
DRY-er (Don't Repeat Yourself) way to do this.

The following will not work:

{% highlight css %}
::-webkit-input-placeholder,
:-moz-placeholder,
::-moz-placeholder,
:-ms-input-placeholder {
   color: red;  
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is because any browser must be able to "understand" each of the the
selectors in the comma-separated series for the styles within the braces
to be applied.


## Use Sass to style placeholders

One solution to this repetetive CSS is to use a Sass mixin. This is the
one that I use in 99% of my projects:

{% highlight scss %}
@mixin input-placeholder {
	::-webkit-input-placeholder {
		@content;
	}
	:-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 18- */
		@content;
	}
	::-moz-placeholder {  /* Firefox 19+ */
		@content;
	}
	:-ms-input-placeholder {  
		@content;
	}
}

/* usage */

@include input-placeholder {
	color:red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This allows me to set the styles for placeholders in all browsers with
a single Sass `@include` which helps keep the code shorter and more
maintainable.


## Be careful of specificity when styling placeholders

In the IE browser, setting styles on an input can override the styles
set for the placeholder text.

{% highlight css %}
:-ms-input-placeholder {
	color:red;
}
input[type="text"] { 
	color: blue; /* placeholder text will be blue in IE */
}
{% endhighlight %}

Ensure IE placeholder styles have higher specificity so they appear as
expected. This could even be a case for using `!important` but always be
careful if using that poweful tool.


## Be aware of opacity of placeholders

In Firefox, placeholder text has a default `opacity` of around `0.5` so
setting `color:red` on the placeholder will result in a muted color
unless you also set `opacity:1`.

Even if you're using
[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) this isn't
reset for you. If fully opaque placeholders are key to your project, do
keep this tip in mind!

Hopefully these tips come in handy but if you have any of your own that
I haven't covered here, do [shoot me

  Hover is a pseudo class and can be used to style state. The hover state is 
  active when a users mouse enters the bounding box of an element and is 
  inactive when the users mouse leaves it. In this episode, weâ€™ll look at 
  the :hover pseudo class on text links and create a CSS dropdown menu 
  triggered by hover and enhanced with jQuery for touch devices.

There's not too much more I can say about hover that I haven't already
covered in the [H video](http://www.atozcss.com/h).  However, there are
some really cool animations that you can apply for a hover state.
Google 'css hover effects' and you'll find plenty.

Here's a couple of sites that have some nifty effects:

* [Codrops: CSS transition hover effects](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/08/circle-hover-effects-with-css-transitions/)
* [Design Shack: Copy + Paste hover effects](http://designshack.net/articles/css/5-cool-css-hover-effects-you-can-copy-and-paste/)
* [CSS-Tricks: pop hovers](https://css-tricks.com/pop-hovers/)

Further to those, I recently produced [a video for Code
School](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/hover-css) all about a library called
[hover.css](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover/blob/master/css/hover.css)

Another CSS H (that I haven't gone into much detail about on this site) is `height`.

The height property is used to define the content height on a containing
element.  All the standard length units (like px, em, rem, %, vw, vh and
others) can be used to control `height`.

If the height of an element is not specifically set, it's calculated as
the minimum height to hold all the containing elements (corresponding to
the default value `auto`).

It's generally advisable to avoid explicity setting height on any
elements as it restricts the flexibility of the element - meaning it
can't grow as the content changes. This is particularly risky when
working on a responsive design when content needs to reflow vertically
as the available width changes. 

As such, I tend to only set `height` on elements that have predefined
dimensions - like images. Another use case is when using `absolute` or
`fixed` position as `height` (and `width`) shrink wrap around positioned
elements. 

Here's an example that demonstrates the problem with setting a fixed height.

<div data-height="268" data-theme-id="17492" data-slug-hash="pjyPxX" data-default-tab="css" data-user="atozcss" class='codepen'><pre><code>p {
  width: 300px;
  height: 70px;
  padding: 10px; 
  background-color:#66d9ef;  /* blue */
}</code></pre>
<p>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/atozcss/pen/pjyPxX/'>pjyPxX</a> by Guy Routledge (<a href='http://codepen.io/atozcss'>@atozcss</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
</div><script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

While the first set of text looks styled correctly, as soon as the text
is shorter or longer then the styling no longer looks correct - the
containing box appears too big or the text flows outside the box.

A solution to the overflowing text could be to use the overflow
property, but this cuts off the text and makes it unreadable.

This situation could be completely avoided by not specifying height in
the first place. If I can improve the flexiblity of my code without
doing anything at all, that get's my vote!

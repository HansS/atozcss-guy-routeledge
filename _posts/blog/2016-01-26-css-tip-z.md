  Some interface designs may call for elements to be layered or stacked on
  top of each other. There are many ways that elements will naturally stack on top of each
  other. But we can control this stacking order using a combination of the
  `position` and `z-index` properties.

Predictably, the final tip in this blog series is all about `z-index`.

As discussed in the original screencast [all about
`z-index`](http://www.atozcss.com/z), it's a property used to control
the ordering of layers in the document. There are a few
complexities around stacking context (also covered in the video) but by
and large, `z-index` is fairly limited in features. 

However, there are always details to dive into in the pursuit of
sharpening your skills and becoming a master of your craft. Let's
have a look at a couple of tips for working with `z-index`.

## `z-index` only works for positioned elements

If you want to control the stacking order of elements, you can do so
with `z-index`. But `z-index` will only take affect if the element also
has a `position` value of `absolute`, `relative` or `fixed`.

Placing elements precisely with position is great for building up
complex layouts or interesting UI patterns but it's common to want to
control stacking order without moving the element from its original
place on the page.

If this is the case, you can just set `position:relative` but not
provide any values for `top`, `right`, `bottom` or `left`. The element
will remain in its original place on the page, the [document
flow](http://www.atozcss.com/books) won't be interrupted and `z-index`
values will take affect.


## You can have negative `z-index`

Layering elements is often done to build up complex shapes
or UI components. This often means layering elements on top of each
other, with ever-increasing values of `z-index`. To place an element on
a layer below another one, it just has to have a lower value of
`z-index` but that lower value *can* be negative.

One area where this comes in useful is when using [pseudo
elements](http://www.atozcss.com/p) and wanting to position them behind
the content of their parent element.

Due to the way [stacking context](http://www.atozcss.com/z) works,
a negative value of `z-index` is needed on any `:before` or `:after`
elements if they are to be positioned behind the text content of their
parent element.

Take a look at the following Codepen and experiment with various values
of `z-index`.

## Use steps of 100 for setting `z-index`

When dealing with `z-index`, it's not uncommon to see code like this:

{% highlight css %}
.modal {
	z-index:99999;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This just looks hacky to me (and only gets worse when appended with
`!important`). Seeing values like this is often symptomatic of
a developer not understanding stacking context and trying to force one
layer to be on top of another.

Instead of using arbitrary numbers like `9999` or `53` or `12`, we can
systemise our `z-index` scale and bring a bit more order to proceedings.
This isn't (just) because I have developer OCD. Honest.

Instead of using single digit increments for my z-index, I use
increments of 100.

{% highlight css %}
.layer-one   { z-index:100; }
.layer-two   { z-index:200; }
.layer-three { z-index:300; }
{% endhighlight %}

I do this to keep things organised but also to be mindful of the number
of different layers being used throughout a project. Another benefit is
that if a new layer needs to be added between two others, there are 99
potential values to pick from in between.

When building a `z-index` system, this manual approach is pretty solid
but can be made more flexible when combined with the powers of
a pre-processor like [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com).

Fortunately, the next season of AtoZ CSS videos is just around the
corner and that's going to focus entirely on the topic of Sass. We'll
take a whole new set of concepts, techniques and approaches to styling
and be kicking off that series in March 2016. 

Sign up for the newsletter to make sure you don't miss out on the launch
or the introductory Sass series that will be coming out in February.

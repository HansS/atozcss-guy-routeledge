This week's #csstips are all about text and typography. In the original
screencast video we looked at all sorts of different [CSS properties to
do with text styling](http://www.atozcss.com/t). But that we've yet to
cover in depth on AtoZ CSS is Open Type features. 

This family of properties add all sorts of typographic goodness to your
text and, as long as you have access to fonts that offer these features,
will really give the reading experience a boost for your users.

Let's start with where you might find these fancy fonts.

## Use a premium font service

With the `@font-face` directive in CSS, we can load up any custom font
into our projects. This may come from a service like [Google
Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) or you may create a webfont of
your own using a generator like [Font
Squirel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com). Both these services offer a load of
great, free fonts but sometimes you may want some more professional,
premium typefaces from a paid service like [Adobe
Typekit](http://www.typekit.com), [Fonts.com](http://www.fonts.com) or
one of the may others.

Not only do these premium services provide top quality fonts, they
do a lot of magic behind the scenes to improve the legibility, the
delivery and performance of loading the fonts themselves. I'd love to go
into depth on this at some point in the future but it kinda goes over my
head at the moment!

I currently use Adobe Typekit for deliverying fonts for client projects
and have been pretty happy with the service so far. My only complaint is
that I can't download *all* their fonts for local usage which is a bit of
a pain when needing to design with these fonts in Sketch/Photoshop.

But one of the major benefits is that they offer a number of fonts with
open type features. Having a font that supports open type features is
the first step in being able to work through the following handful of
tips.

## Turn on ligatures

Ligatures are an open type feature that replace common sequences of
multiple characters with a single character for improved legibility and
more elegant visual appearance.

<br>Example of ligatures from [Typekit](http://help.typekit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1789736-syntax-for-opentype-features-in-css#liga)

Classic examples are combinations of letters like `ff` or `fi`, `fl`,
`ffi` or `th`. When viewed as multiple characters, the letters can seem
as though there's too much space between them. Ligatures just flow
better. It's a micro optimisation but it looks classy and you'll impress
all your type nerd friends.

To use ligatures in CSS (if your typeface supports them) you can use the
following snippet:

{% highlight css %}
body {
  font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;
  font-feature-settings: "liga", "clig"; /* for IE */
}
{% endhighlight %}

There is an alternate syntax for setting `font-feature-settings` instead
which allows a comma separated list of open type features to be set in
one go - a bit like shorthand for `margin` or `padding`.

Ligatures are turned on by default if you use Safari but to ensure
Firefox, Opera, Chrome and IE (10+) get the best reading experience,
you'll need to set this explicitly.

## Use swashes to add flourish

If you're working on a project that requires that little extra
typographic flourish, you can use the swashes open type feature. This
will take key characters in your text and replace them with swash
glphys; these are the same letters but much more extravagant.

![](/img/swashes.png)
<br>Example of swashes from [Typekit](http://help.typekit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1789736-syntax-for-opentype-features-in-css#swsh)

To turn on swashes, use the following snippet:

{% highlight css %}
.fancy-title {
  font-feature-settings: "swsh";
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Improve letter-spacing with kerning

In the [text screencast](http://www.atozcss.com/t) we discussed
properties like `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` for controlling the
space between characters and words. But for extra control and better
legibility, we can use the open type feature of `font-kerning`.

Kerning is the process of adjusting the space between certain
combinations of characters so that they are the most appropriate for the
reader. This is something that designers may obsess over, by hand, in
graphics packages like Illustrator or Photoshop but have often had to
relinquish control of as soon as text gets to the browser.

This feature can be enabled by setting the `font-kerning` or
`font-feature-settings` property as follows:

{% highlight css %}
body {
  font-kerning: normal;
  font-feature-settings: "kern";
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Set multiple open type features at once

We've looked at three of the most common and most impressive open type
features but there are many more. If you want to leverage these powerful
features, it's likely that you'll want to set many of them all at once.
And we can do that with the `font-variant` or `font-feature-settings`
shorthands.

The reason for discussing both of these properties is due to browser
support issues. At the time of writing, IE10 supports
`font-feature-settings` but doesn't support the other open type
properties like `font-kerning` or `font-variant` properties. Safari does
support the individual properties like `font-kerning` but doesn't
recognise `font-feature-settings`.

So, to turn on all the features just discussed, we need to use the
following set of properties to cover our bases:

{% highlight css %}
body {
  font-variant: common-ligatures;
  font-kerning: "kern";
  font-feature-settings: "liga", "clig", "swsh", "kern";
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Use a boilerplate to kick start your open type experience

If all this feels like a bit too much to get your head around and you'd
like something quick and easy to get you up and running, I totally
understand and fortunately, there's something to help you out.

You may be familiar with
[normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) which is a CSS
"reset" used to normalise user agent stylesheets across browsers.

I recently stumbled across
[normalise-opentype.css](http://kennethormandy.com/journal/normalize-opentype-css)
which adds open type features with all the necessary properties and
fallbacks for deep browser support whilst giving you all the open type
goodness. The [normalise-opentype project is on
github](https://github.com/kennethormandy/normalize-opentype.css) and
using it is as simple as downloading and linking up an additional
stylesheet or adding it to your set of pre-processor `@imports` if using
one of those.

It's a great looking tool and I'll be experimenting with it on my next
project for sure!

  There’s a number of pseudo classes in CSS. These pseudo classes help us style different states and target specific
  elements based on their relationship or position to other elements. The :enabled and :disabled pseudo classes style form
  elements that can or cannot be filled in or selected.
---

The `:enabled` pseudo class can be used to style the enabled state of
form elements such as `button`, `input`, `optgroup`, `option`, `select`
and `textarea` elements.  Elements that can have an `:enabled` state
also have a corresponding `:disabled` state. 

These states are set by the boolean `disabled` attribute.  It's
important to note that there isn't an "enabled" attribute even though
there is an `:enabled` pseudo class.

{% highlight html %}
<input type="text">
<input type="text" disabled>
{% endhighlight %}

Therefore these elements can be styled either by their pseudo class,
with an attribute selector or with a negated attribute selector: 

{% highlight css %}
input:enabled { }
input:not( [disabled] ) { }
input:disabled { }
input[disabled] { }
{% endhighlight %}

There's no real difference between using any of these; they're all
supported in IE9+ and they all have the same specificity. 

I’m not sure how often using these selectors will come up, but it’s
interesting to look at all the different ways of approaching the same
problem.

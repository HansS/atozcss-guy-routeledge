  In this quick tip, we'll look at a shorthand for setting font-size and
  line-height together to save yourself a couple of extra keystrokes.
---

`line-height`, as discussed in the [original screencast
video](http://www.atozcss.com/l), is a property for setting the height of
a line in CSS. It's similar (but slightly different) to [leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading) in print
design.

## Tip 1

`line-height` only applies to elements that have their `display` set to
`inline` or `inline-block` and it actually sets the height of the line
box that bounds the element. If you set `line-height` on a block
element, you may still see some changes to your styles but it's actually
the `inline` *child* elements that are being affected as `line-height`
is an inherited property. 

When setting `line-height` without a unit (as I recommend in the video),
the computed value is the `line-height` multiplied by the current
element's `font-size`.

{% highlight css %}
p {
	font-size:20px;
	font-family:'Avenir', sans-serif;
	line-height: 1.5; /* 30px */
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Tip 2

If you need to set both `line-height` and `font-size` at the same time,
there's a handy shorthand via the `font` property.

This shorthand allows you to set `font-style`, `font-variant`,
`font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height` and `font-family` in a single
line.

The snippet from the tip above, could be combined into a single `font`
shorthand as follows:

{% highlight css %}
p {
	font: 20px/1.5 'Avenir', sans-serif;
}
{% endhighlight %}

When using this shorthand syntax, the order of declaration is important.

1. The `font-family` must be the last declaration
1. The `line-height` must follow the `font-size` immediately and be
   separated by a forward slash `/`
1. `font-style`, `font-variant` and `font-weight` must be defined before
   `font-size` and `line-height`.

A full example using all the available font properties may look as follows:

{% highlight css %}
p {
	/* style | variant | weight | size/line-height | family */

	font: italic small-caps 700 20px/1.5 'Avenir', sans-serif;
}
{% endhighlight %}

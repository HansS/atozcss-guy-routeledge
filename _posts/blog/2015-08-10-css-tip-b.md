If you chose to use `box-sizing: border-box` across your site you can run into problems when you add widgets/plugins that use `content-box`.

To get around any display issues, make the following adjustment to your CSS code:

{% highlight css %}
html {
box-sizing: border-box;
}

, :before, *:after {
box-sizing: inherit;
}
{% endhighlight %}

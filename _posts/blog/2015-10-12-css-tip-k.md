  In this week's tip we look at ways to handle vendor prefixes and
  a quick tip for refactoring your @keyframes into a more condensed
  format.

We talked a lot about `@keyframes` in the [K
video](http://www.atozcss.com/k).  Here's a couple of extra tips that
you might find useful when working with CSS animations (and any current
or future experiemental properties).

## Tip 1

When setting up your keyframes for an animation, it's quite common for
certain points of the animation to share the same values for particular
properties. Instead of having a long list of keyframes, you can combine
them into a comma separated list, just like you would with selectors
that share the same properties and values.

{% highlight css %}
@keyframes pulse {
	0%, 50% { font-size: 10px }
	25%, 100% {font-size: 20px }
}

/* just like */
h1, h2, h3 {
	font-family: 'Avenir', sans-serif;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Tip 2

Support for CSS animations is very good -- at the time of writing 
the [global support is 89.5%](http://www.caniuse.com/animation) and all supporting browsers have both
`@keyframes` and `animation` unprefixed. 

However, to ensure backwards compatibility with Safari 8 and iOS 8.4 and
below, you'll need `-webit` vendor prefixes to ensure your animations
actually play. Adding these manually can make your code bloated and hard
to maintain as every tiny change will need to be replicated in multiple
places. This can be prone to human error which is never a good thing.

There are two ways that you can keep your code nice and clean, and also
avoid the manual task of duplication.

You could use the [-prefix-free JavaScript
library](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) by [Lea
Verou](http://www.twitter.com/leaverou).  This takes care of all the
prefixing for you so you just write the unprefixed code and the script
runs in the browser and injects all the necessary prefixes for you based
on support for features in the browser currently being used.

Another option is to use
[Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). This is a CSS
post-processer that you run after you've finished writing your
unprefixed code - usually as part of an automated task runner like
[Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) or [Gulp](http://www.gulpjs.com).
Autoprefixer uses info from [caniuse.com](caniuse.com) to determine what
prefixes are required.

I personally use Autoprefixer with a Gulp task and haven't written
a vendor prefix for months. It's a great tip to speed up your workflow and
works for all CSS properties, not just `@keyframes`!

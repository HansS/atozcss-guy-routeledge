  Animation used to be the realm of JavaScript. Now, in modern browsers,
  we can animate elements using CSS. The @keyframes block and animation
  properties allow us to specify what gets animated and when.

We talked a lot about @keyframes in the K video.  Here's a couple of extra tips that you might find useful when using @keyframes.

## Tip 1

During transitions where you are setting properties to the same value at different stages of the animation, you can specify them at the same time by comma separating the percentages.

{% highlight %}
	@keyframes fontbounce {
		0%, 50% { font-size: 10px }
		25%, 100% {font-size: 20px }
	}
{% endhighlight %}
 


## Tip 2

There's not as much support for @keyframes and animation as many other CSS properties and so you will end up duplicating a lot of your code with the -webkit prefixes. It makes what would otherwise be beautiful code start to look a bit messy.

There are two ways that you can keep your code nice and clean, and also avoid the manual task of duplicating your code.

You could use the -prefix-free JavaScript library written by Lea Verou. You just write the unprefixed code and the script runs in the background and adds all the extra prefixed lines for you. Genius!

Another option is to use Autprefixer. It's a CSS post-processer that you run after you've finished your wizardry and are ready to release to production. The system uses info from caniuse.com to calculate what prefixes are needed.

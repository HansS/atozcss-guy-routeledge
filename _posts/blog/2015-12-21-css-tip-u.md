Unicode characters can be really handy for adding little symbols and
icons to your HTML or in your CSS via pseudo elements' content property.
Here are a handful of tips for using unicode characters.

## Set the character set in your CSS

If you want to use unicode characters in your CSS file, ensure to set
the character set for your CSS in addition to setting the `charset` meta
tag in your HTML document.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- in your HTML <head> -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
/* in your CSS at the top of the file*/
@charset 'utf-8';
{% endhighlight %}

## Use the Trigram for Heaven symbol as a simple hamburger icon

When needing to knock together a quick demo site or a video screencast
for a responsive tutorial, I often use the love-it-or-hate-it hamburger
icon for a mobile menu. There are lots of icon solutions out there and
there are many [non-raster approaches to the hamburger icon](webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/7-non-raster-approaches-for-making-the-hamburger-menu-icon--cms-21686) but often the
quickest and easiest for me is to use the unicode character called "The
Trigram for Heaven" which looks like this: `☰`.

It looks just like a hamburger icon. And here's how I'd often add it to
my nav:

{% highlight html %}
<nav class="site-nav">
  <ul class="site-nav-menu">
    <li><a href="#">lorem ipsum</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">lorem ipsum</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">lorem ipsum</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">lorem ipsum</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">lorem ipsum</a></li>
  </ul>
  <a href="#" class="site-nav-icon">☰</a>
</nav>
{% endhighlight %}

## Search for and quickly copy and paste unicode characters

I came across the hamburger character whilst searching through the
library of available unicode characters at [copypastecharacter.com](http://www.copypastecharacter.com/).

They have a whole load of arrows, graphical shapes, mathematical
symbols, punctuation and some weird and wonderful one-off characters for
you to search through and easily copy and paste into your code. Pretty
handy stuff.

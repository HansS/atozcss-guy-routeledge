In the video episode for [J](http://www.atozcss.com/j) we discussed the text-align property and how it can be used to justify text on a page.
There is also a justify-content property if using flexbox to position elements within a flex container.
Each property defines how the browser will distribute space between and around flex items along the main axis of their parent container.

There are five different values for justify-content:
* flex-start (default): items are placed at the start of the containing element
* flex-end: items are at the end of the containing element
* center: items are centered within the containing element
* space-between: items are spaced out across the entire width of the containing element, with the first child element at the start and the final child element at the end
* space-around: items are spaced out with equal space around them, including space at the start and the end.

Have a look at this example to see the different results when you change the value of the justify-content property.

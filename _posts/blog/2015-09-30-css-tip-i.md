  IDs may not be the most suitable way of selecting elements for styling
  with CSS but the ID attribute does have its uses. In this tip, we'll
  look at 3 cases where they are the right choice.

In the [I video](http://www.atozcss.com/i) we looked at the ID selector
and how it factors into CSS. I also had a good rant about the issues
with using `id` over `class`, both in terms of reusability and
specificity.

To balance the argument a little I should talk about when we should use ID and why.

### To provide a unique hook for Javascript

This is a little outside the normal scope of CSS (although not if you
believe [do we even need CSS any
more](https://css-tricks.com/the-debate-around-do-we-even-need-css-anymore/)
it's a useful piece of advice none the less. The fastest and most direct
way of interacting with an element with JavaScript is to target it by
its `id` attribute.

### To provide targeted anchor tags for navigation

IDs can be used on a single page for navigation by setting the href in an anchor tag to the id.
Check out this example that allows you to navigate easily to different chapters on the page.

<div data-height="268" data-theme-id="17492" data-slug-hash="VvKeKV" data-default-tab="css" data-user="atozcss" class='codepen'><pre><code>a {
  text-decoration: none;
}
li {
  display: inline-block;
  list-style: none; 
  padding: 10px;
}</code></pre>

### For linking form inputs with their labels

When building forms, we can link the `label` of a particular `input` by
the `for` attribute on the `label` with the corresponding `id` attribute
of the input. This means that clicking on the label will focus a text
input field or toggle the state of checboxes or radio buttons.

And, finally, here's one last tip about using IDs:

* a valid `id` cannot start with a number and must be at least one character long

  In this week's tip, we're talking B for Box Model and about a "new and improved" approach for setting `box-sizing` across a whole project.
---

If you chose to use `box-sizing: border-box` across your site (you should) you can run into problems when you add widgets/plugins that use the default `content-box` sizing model.

To get around any display issues, use the following snippet instead of `* { box-sizing: border-box }`:

{% highlight css %}
html {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *:before, *:after {
	box-sizing: inherit;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is currently considered the best practice for applying `box-sizing` across a project although with the always changing nature of front-end development, who knows how long that might last!

  The web would be a pretty dull place without a splash of colour.
  There are a number of different properties that take a colour value and
  there are four different colour syntaxes in CSS and that’s what we’ll be
  focusing on in this video.  Those formats are colour keywords, hex, RGB
  and HSL.

Not only can we use the `color` property to change the behaviour of our website, but also the behaviour of the browser.

It is really easy to change the default browser highlight colors using the background and color properties on the `::selection` pseudo-element.

{% highlight css %}
::selection {
background: red;
color: white;
}

::-moz-selection {
background: red;
color: white;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above will apply to all selections, so you will need to be more specific if you wish to apply different colours to different elements on a page.


And another small tip: a great place to find and create color themes is on the adobe site. Have a look on the Explore tab if you want to see existing themes.

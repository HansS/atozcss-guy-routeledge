  The web would be a pretty dull place without a splash of colour.
  There are a number of different properties that take a colour value and
  there are four different colour syntaxes in CSS and that’s what we’ll be
  focusing on in this video.  Those formats are colour keywords, hex, RGB
  and HSL.

	<p>Layout is hard. It's something I struggled with when I started
	out and it's something that always raises lots of questions in the
	classroom.</p>

	<p>To help ease the pain, I've compiled a guide to <em>layout &amp; document flow</em>
	to help both beginners and experienced web professionals sharpen this
	fundamental skill.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Learn to master CSS layout by writing <em>LESS</em> code.</li>
		<li>Learn how document flow works and how to control it.</li>
		<li>Learn techniques you can use <em>now</em> on production sites.</li>
		<li>Learn about the future of CSS layout.</li>
		<li>And much, much more!</li>
	</ul>

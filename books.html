	<p>Layout is hard. It's something I struggled with when I started
	out and it's something that always raises lots of questions in the

	<p>To help ease the pain, I've compiled a guide to <em>layout &amp; document flow</em>
	to help both beginners and experienced web professionals sharpen this
	fundamental skill.</p>

	<p>I have recently discovered the joy of teaching.</p>

	<p>As a contract front-end developer, I have the opportunity to work with
	a wide variety of clients on a range of different projects. But I've
	recently been working with
	<a href="http://www.generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General&nbsp;Assembly</a>
	<em>teaching</em> front-end development and been loving every minute of it.
	It's been a whole new set of challenges but incredibly rewarding &mdash; and
	has proved to me just how much I love what I do.</p>

	<p>Classroom teaching is great, but in an effort to spread the front-end love far
	and wide, I've put together my first video series on my favourite topic:
	CSS. The plan is to produce a 26-part series, tackling a different CSS
	topic &mdash; one for each letter of the alphabet.</p>

	<p>CSS is what got me hooked on web development, which in turn has given me
	an incredible quality of life; the freedom to work on the projects
	I choose, a healthy bank balance and numerous business and investment
	opportunities. I learnt almost everything I know from watching other
	peoples' screencasts, so this is my chance to (hopefully) do the same
	for others.</p>

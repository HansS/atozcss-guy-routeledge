<p>I have recently discovered the joy of teaching.</p>

<p>As a contract front-end developer, I have the opportunity to work with
a wide variety of clients on a range of different projects. But I've
recently been working with
<a href="http://www.generalasseb.ly" target="_blank">General&nbsp;Assembly</a>
<em>teaching</em> front-end development and been loving every minute of it.
It's been a whole new set of challenges but incredibly rewarding - and
has proved to me just how much I love what I do.</p>

<p>Classroom teaching is great, but in an effort to spread the front-end love far
and wide, I've put together my first video series on my favourite topic:
CSS. The plan is to produce a 26-part series, tackling a different CSS
topic - one for each letter of the alphabet.</p>

<p>CSS is what got me hooked on web development, which in turn has given me
an incredible quality of life; the freedom to work on the projects
I choose, a healthy bank balance and numerous business and investment
opportunites. I learnt almost everything I know from watching other
peoples' screencasts, so this is my chance to (hopefully) do the same
for others.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Slides are designed and animated in Keynote - as was the opening
sequence.</p>

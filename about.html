	<p>Hi, I'm <a href="http://www.twitter.com/guyroutledge">Guy Routledge</a>
	and I'm the voice of AtoZ CSS.</p>

	<img src="/img/me.png" class="about-image" alt="A photo of Guy Routledge">

	<p>I learned everything I know from reading blogs and watching
	screencasts.  Now <strong>I'm sharing what I've learned</strong> so
	you can sharpen your skills and stay up to date in the fast-moving
	world of web development.</p>

	<p>As a contract front-end developer, I have the opportunity to work
	with a wide variety of clients on a range of different projects. But
	I’ve been working closely with <a href="http://www.generalassemb.ly"
	target="_blank">General&nbsp;Assembly</a> <em>teaching</em>
	front-end development in London and have been loving every minute of it.
	It’s been a whole new set of challenges but incredibly rewarding &mdash;
	and has proved to me just how much <strong>I love what I do.</strong></p>

	<p>Classroom teaching is great, but in an effort to spread the
	front-end love far and wide, I’ve put together this site and these
	videos on my favourite topic: CSS. The first series of 26 videos
	tackles a different CSS topic, concept, selector, property or value
	&mdash; one for each letter of the alphabet.</p>

	<p>CSS is what got me hooked on web development, which in turn has
	given me an <strong>incredible quality of life</strong>; the freedom
	to work on the projects I choose, a flexible schedule, the
	opportunity to build other businesses and invest in my future and
	the chance to share valueable knowledge through speaking, teaching
	and writing. My hope is that the resources here help you acheive your
	goals and aspirations too.</p>

	<p><strong>My goal with this site is to share knowledge and empower
	you to design, build and launch amazing projects for yourself,
	your employer or your clients.</strong></p>

	<p>If there's anything you need a hand with, just <a
		href="http://www.twitter.com/atozcss">shoot me a tweet</a> and
	ask away. If there's any topic you'd like to see covered in future
	videos, articles, books or courses please let me know.</p>

	<p>Cheers.</p>

	<p>If you find these videos at all useful or entertaining, I’d really
	appreciate a rating and review on iTunes - it’s by far the best way to
	spread the word about the series. I’ll be giving a shout-out to all
	reviewers in the weekly emails so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for
	your name!</p>

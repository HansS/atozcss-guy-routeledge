	<p>AtoZ CSS is now available as an iTunes video podcast. Get videos
	beamed to your podcasting app of choice as soon as they're published.</p>

	<p>If you find these videos at all useful or entertaining, I’d really
	appreciate a rating and review on iTunes - it’s by far the best way to
	spread the word about the series. I’ll be giving a shout-out to all
	reviewers in the weekly emails so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for
	your name!</p>

	there, to save the hassle of trawling the internet for all your
	video content.</p>

	feature yet! Add the AtoZ CSS feed to your reader of
	choice and enjoy!</p>

CSS is a declarative language rather than a programming language and
many purists think that it should be kept that way. 

However, in my experience I've come across many times when having the
power of logical flow control within my styling has been hugely
beneficial.

In this video you'll learn about:

* The three different types of loops in Sass
* Working with conditional statements
* And some practical applications for both of these powerful features

## Loops

* for
* while
* each

Show code snippets of each and the output CSS

## Conditional Statements

* if
* if/else
* if/else/elsif

Also demonstrate not

## A practical example

Outputting a series of colour swatches with dark/light text depending
on the brightness of the swatch

For a more complex use of loops and conditional statements, we could
create a function that checks actual colour contrast instead of just
measuring lightness.

## Outro

In the next episode we'll be discussing M for "Map Variables" a new 
variable type that was added in Sass 3.3 and a great way to hold stores
of multiple named values.

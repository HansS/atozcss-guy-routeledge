excerpt: >
  When using new or experimental CSS, it can be useful to know
  if the browser supports the features we're writing code for.

  Feature detection is often done in JavaScript with tools like Modernizr
  but in some browsers, we can now detect capabilities from CSS.

  The `@supports` rule allows us to conditionally apply styles for
  features that are or are not supported.

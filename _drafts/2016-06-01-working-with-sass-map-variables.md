In a previous video we discussed the various data types of Sass
variables.

One variable type we didn't have time to go into detail on is *map
variables* but the time has come to remedy that.

In this video you'll learn about:

* All about Map variables, how to create them and what to store in them
* Using values from map variables
* Querying and merging maps together
* And finally a practical example of using maps in a real project

## What Are Map Variables?

## Using Map Values

## Querying and Merging

## Practical Example

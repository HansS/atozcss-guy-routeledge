excerpt: >
  Pseudo elements are elements on the page that aren't found in the HTML
  code.  They can be manipulated with any CSS that would be applied to
  any other element.  Two special pseudo elements - `:before` and
  `:after` can be used to generate content on the page from CSS and have
  many potential use cases.

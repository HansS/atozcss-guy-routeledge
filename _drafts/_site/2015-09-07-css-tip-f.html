<p>Floating is great if you want to move an element to the left or right of a page, but it cannot be used to center an element. What a pain right?</p>

<p>Well, never fear, there are two easy ways to center an element, and probably a whole load of complicated ways.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>use <code>margin:auto</code></p>

    <p><code>margin:auto</code> will create an equal sized margin on each side of the element within its containing element.  Thus if you wish to center on the page you need the containing element to have width set to the full width of the window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use flexbox (another F property, yay!)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

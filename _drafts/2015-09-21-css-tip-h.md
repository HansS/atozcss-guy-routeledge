excerpt: >
  Hover is a pseudo class and can be used to style state. The hover state is 
  active when a users mouse enters the bounding box of an element and is 
  inactive when the users mouse leaves it. In this episode, weâ€™ll look at 
  the :hover pseudo class on text links and create a CSS dropdown menu 
  triggered by hover and enhanced with jQuery for touch devices.

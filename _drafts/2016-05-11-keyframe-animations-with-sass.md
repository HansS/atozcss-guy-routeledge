Animations are great. We covered them back in the first series of AtoZ
CSS and now we'll look at the Sassy variety too!

In this video you'll learn:

* How to create a mixin for outputting keyframes with vendor prefixes
* How to add autoprefixer to Grunt/Gulp to never worry about prefixes ever again
* How Sass handles nested keyframes and the @at-root directive





## Outro

In the next episode we'll be discussing L for "Loops" and dive into more of
the programatic power of Sass with flow control like conditional
statements. I hope you can join me next time.

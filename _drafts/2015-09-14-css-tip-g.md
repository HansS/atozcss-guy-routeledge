  General sibling is a little known but very useful CSS selector.
  It allows the styling of an element that is a sibling of another.
  Weâ€™ll look at the syntax, a practical example and then a quick round up
  of the other child and sibling selectors in CSS.

In the G video we looked at the general sibling selector which allows styling of a sibling element.
There's also the other child and sibling selectors for traversing down/across an element tree. 

But what about parent selectors?
Yep, you guessed it, parents missed out in CSS3.

But the good news is that they've made it into the CSS Selectors Level 4 spec. Woo Hoo!
The parent selector, or the subject of the selector as its also called, allows you to select a parent element for styling.
The latest draft of the spec uses an exclamation mark after the given selector to select the element.

The classic example of when you might want to style a parent element is in a menu.
A navigation menu is normally an unordered list with a series of list items that have an anchor which can be clicked to activate the option.
It has always been tricky to style the correspoding list item when an anchor was clicked, or made active.
With the new parent selector it's simple:

{% highlight css %}

ul li! a:active {
	background-color: blue;
	color: white;
}

{% endhighlight %}

Level 4 has not yet been released as official documentation and I don't know of any browser that supports it.
But when it does get released it is certainly going to come in handy for styling parent elements.

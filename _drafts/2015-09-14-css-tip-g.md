excerpt: >
  General sibling is a little known but very useful CSS selector.
  It allows the styling of an element that is a sibling of another.
  Weâ€™ll look at the syntax, a practical example and then a quick round up
  of the other child and sibling selectors in CSS.

The general sibling combinantor (~) is used to find any following sibling.

The adjacent sibling combinator (+) is used to only the adjacent sibling, if one exists.

There is no previous sibling combinator in CSS, but this can be achieved in Javascript.

Similarly, there is no selector to match elements that are not siblings. This can be done in Javascript or jquery too.

Maybe talk about the parent selector new in CSS level 4 selectors.

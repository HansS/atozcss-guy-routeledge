excerpt: >
  The opacity property specifies how opaque an element is. It takes
  a value ranging from 0 to 1 where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is
  completely opaque. In this practical episode we'll look at how the
  opacity property works - including some of it's downsides - and then
  create a CSS only fading slideshow using `opacity` and what we learned
  about `@keyframes` in Episode 11.

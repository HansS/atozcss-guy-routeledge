  How elements take up space on the page is controlled by their display.

  There used to be two broad display types in CSS: elements were "inline" 
  or "block-level" but thereâ€™s a bit more to it than that...

Not all things are equal when we don't want to `display` content.

`display:none` is not the same as `visibility:hidden`

* `display:none` does not allocate any space on the page; the element is removed from the normal flow of the page
* `visibility:hidden` does allocate space; the item simply cannot be seen


<div data-height="268" data-theme-id="17492" data-slug-hash="XboRoE" data-default-tab="css" data-user="atozcss" class='codepen'><pre><code>div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid grey;
}

.display-test {
  display: none;
}
.vis-test {
  visibility: hidden;
}</code></pre>

Notice how there is blank space in the second box where a paragraph has been hidden. There is no allocated space in the first box that uses `display:none`.

In both cases the item can still be interacted with via the dom, but not the child elements in the `display:none` case.

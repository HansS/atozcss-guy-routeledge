excerpt: >
  The CSS `line-height` property acts in a similar way to leading in print
  design.

  It allows us to control the spacing between lines in paragraphs,
  headings and other text elements.

  Line-height can also be used as a base to create consistent vertical
  rhythm and spacing throught an entire project.

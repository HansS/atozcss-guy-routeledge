excerpt: >
  Text is everywhere. Without it, the web wouldn't be such a valuable
  resource.  There are many different CSS properties for styling text
  and in this video we'll cover most of them in some way shape or form.
  As there are so many things to cover, this episode will demo a 
  selection but in part just act as an overview of the tools in the box.

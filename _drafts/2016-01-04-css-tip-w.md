  More and more these days, CSS is being used to control the styling of
  things other than websites.

  One type of media that CSS can apply styling to is paged media - things
  like digital magazines and ebooks or a website in the form of a print
  stylesheet.

  There are some properties that only apply to this media type. The
  `widows` and `orphans` properties are two that allow us to control how
  lines of text flow around page breaks.

			<p>Well, if you didn’t, you do&nbsp;now!</p>
			<p>Learn the fundamental building blocks of CSS, all about float, inline-block. There's a whole practical
			section which steps through the process of writing the CSS for a recipe blog and then a final section all
			about CSS of the future - flexbox and the new grid layout&nbsp;spec.</p>
			<p>If you prefer watching to reading, there’s also a 90-minute video series to accompany the practical
			section of the book. How handy is&nbsp;that?</p>
			<p>You can <a href="/books">check out screenshots from the book</a> and <a href="/books">watch a sample video</a>

			26-video series is going to cover everything you need to know to make you a Sass&nbsp;Superhero!</p>
			<p>Make sure you're on the mailing list to hear all about the launch of the next series. But in the&nbsp;meantime...</p>

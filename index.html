		<h2>Dive deeper into CSS with AtoZ Books</h2>

		<p>Blog posts and screencasts are great for quick learning and keeping up to date with what's happening
		in the industry but they can only go into so much detail.</p>

		<p>For more in depth learning, check out <a href="/books">AtoZ CSS Books</a>.</p>

		<p>Need to start using Sass but
		not sure where or how to start? Grab a copy of <a href="/books/up-and-running-with-sass">Up and Running with Sass</a>
		for a practical step-by-step introduction to this powerful preprocessor.</p>

		<p>Want to improve your understanding of document flow and create all manner of modern layouts with CSS?
		Learn the fundamental building blocks of CSS layout; inline elements, block elements, how the cascade works,
		all about float, inline-block and CSS positioning in the <a href="/books/css-layout-and-document-flow">CSS Layout and
		Document Flow</a> book. There's a whole practical section which steps
		through the process of writing the CSS for a whole website and then a final section all about CSS of
		the future - flexbox and the new grid layout&nbsp;spec.</p>

		<p>If you prefer watching to reading, there’s also a 90-minute video series to accompany the practical
		section of the book. How handy is&nbsp;that?</p>

		<p>You can <a href="/books/css-layout-and-document-flow">check out screenshots from the book</a> and <a href="/books/css-layout-and-document-flow">watch a sample video</a>
		before checking out with Stripe.</p>
